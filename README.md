# Scope

I used Gun.js and chokidar to create a file storage/ compressor to use in a Docker volume plugin. Scope stores files in many formats and watches glob patterns. Simple api with types.

## Examples

To scope the mock_files clone the repo and run

```shell
yarn
yarn scope

```

rename the mock_files folder... then unpackage the files back in it's place...

```shell
yarn unpack

```
